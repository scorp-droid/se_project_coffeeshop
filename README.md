This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM

## Plan on improving the project

Could add a radial or linear gradient to header and/or loading sign that looks like coffee beans as user first loads page
